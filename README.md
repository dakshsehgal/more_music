# MORE_MUSIC
A web app that helps you find more music. Simply enter a song, and songs that are more ___ (e.g. groovy, danceable) will be recommended.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. Seeding parameters need to be added, and some bugs with the visualizer need to be fixed. I haven't yet decided how to suggest the next adjectives for the song, or how they will be displayed.
